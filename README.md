## Overview
üé®‚ú® Introducing my all-new Spotify Car Mode experience, designed for drivers who demand more from their music on the move. Gone are the days of fiddly buttons and clunky navigation. Say hello to sleek designs, smooth transitions, and features that make your drive safer and more enjoyable.
## Background
- This study was undertaken as part of my [Human Computer Interaction](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6750-human-computer-interaction) course at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) üêù.

- The goal was to understand user-based iterative design and execute the design life cycle to redesign an existing interface.
- Watch my [Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i7qYM-bE3I&t=1s) where I compare my redesign with the current Car Mode.
